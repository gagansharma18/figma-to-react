To delete a file from every branch of a Git repository, you can create a script that iterates through all branches, deletes the file in each branch, and then commits the deletion. Here's a script you can use:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e  # Exit immediately if any command fails

# Define the file you want to delete
FILE_TO_DELETE="path/to/file.txt"

# Fetch all remote branches and iterate through them
for branch in $(git branch -r | grep -v '\->' | grep -v 'master' | awk '{gsub(/origin\//,"");print}'); do
    git checkout "$branch"  # Checkout each branch
    if git rev-parse --verify --quiet "$FILE_TO_DELETE"; then
        git rm --cached "$FILE_TO_DELETE"  # Remove the file from Git without deleting local copy
        git commit -m "Deleted $FILE_TO_DELETE from branch $branch"  # Commit the deletion
    else
        echo "File $FILE_TO_DELETE does not exist in branch $branch. Skipping."
    fi
done

# Finally, switch back to the original branch you started from
git checkout -

echo "Deletion of $FILE_TO_DELETE from all branches completed."
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set the File to Delete**: Replace `"path/to/file.txt"` with the actual path of the file you want to delete.

2. **Iterate Through Branches**:
   - `git branch -r`: Lists all remote branches.
   - `grep -v '\->'`: Excludes the current branch indicator.
   - `grep -v 'master'`: Excludes the `master` branch (you can modify this pattern as needed).
   - `awk '{gsub(/origin\//,"");print}'`: Removes `origin/` prefix from branch names.

3. **Checkout Each Branch**: Loops through each remote branch and checks it out.

4. **Check File Existence**: Uses `git rev-parse --verify --quiet "$FILE_TO_DELETE"` to check if the file exists in the current branch.

5. **Delete File**: If the file exists in the branch, `git rm --cached "$FILE_TO_DELETE"` removes it from the index without deleting it from your local filesystem.

6. **Commit the Deletion**: `git commit -m "Deleted $FILE_TO_DELETE from branch $branch"` commits the deletion.

7. **Switch Back to Original Branch**: After processing all branches, the script switches back to the branch it started from (`git checkout -`).

8. **Completion Message**: Displays a message when the script completes.

### Usage:

- Save this script to a file (e.g., `delete_file_from_branches.sh`).
- Make the script executable with `chmod +x delete_file_from_branches.sh`.
- Run the script from the root of your Git repository with `./delete_file_from_branches.sh`.

### Notes:

- **Safety Precaution**: This script performs operations that rewrite Git history (deleting files). Ensure you understand the implications before running it, especially if the repository is shared and others might have based their work on these branches.
- **Backup**: Consider backing up your repository or the specific branches before running this script, especially if you're dealing with critical files.
- **Customization**: Modify the script as per your repository's specific needs (e.g., if you have a different default branch than `master`, adjust the `grep -v 'master'` part).
